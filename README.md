Value Game Simulation Program
In this assignment, a simulation program will be implemented for a value-based game utilizing custom chess pieces. The player's decisions will be made using the dynamic programming method, while the opponent will use either the greedy approach or the random approach.

The performance of each decision-making method will be evaluated by measuring their execution times during two trials of the game:

* Trial 1: opponent uses greedy approach
* Trial 2: opponent uses random approach
